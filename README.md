# Dependencies and workflow
1. The bibliography BibTeX file is a concatenation (consider git submodule!) of the respective files from the vita repo.
2. [jekyll minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme provides a minimal layout, which you can adapt or change with another jekyll theme
3. [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) plugin converts the bibliography into basic HTML.
4. [netlify](https://www.netlify.com) builds and deploys the final site.
